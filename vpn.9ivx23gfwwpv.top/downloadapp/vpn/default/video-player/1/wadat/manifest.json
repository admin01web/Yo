// You can change the information in lines like "description", "name", "short_name"
// Note that you need to add the path on the server in the lines "start_url" and "src" (8 and 11 line numbers) instead of <path to the folder on the server>.
// For example, if you have the path "/root/landing/index.html" then your URLs will look like "/root/landing/?is_pwa=1" and "/root/landing/icon.png" respectively
